The LMS Tools are a collection of Python scripts useful when working with LMS.
I suggest using Python 3 but Python 2 should work as well for most scripts.

## Installation
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-lxml python3-numpy python3-matplotlib

git clone https://github.com/lms-org/lms_tools.git
cd lms_tools
sudo ./setup.py install
```

## Script Overview
- `lms-validate.py <directory/file>` - Validate an XML or LCONF file or all such
  files in a given directory.
- `lms-flags.py <directory/file>` - List all referenced flags in all given
  XML files.
- `lms-profiler.py <file>` - Analyze a profiling file generated by LMS.
- `lms-create-mod.py <module_name>` - Generate a skeleton for a module in the
  current working directory.
- `lms-create-lib.py <lib_name>` - Generate a skeleton for a library in the
  current working directory.
- `lms-create-service.py <service_name>` - Generate a skeleton for a service in
  the current working directory.
